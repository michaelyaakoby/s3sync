# == scan/copy/resume/sync/verify(*)
# SNSTask just polls the scheduler until it finds the task with the rd.Tree
# With a scan/copy/resume/sync there is only one Tree which has the stats
# needed for tracking progress
#
# == verify -stats ==
# In the case of verify -stats there are 2 tasks with trees because it
# parallel scans the source and target.  (With regular verify, there is
# just the source tree being scanned and the target being verified does
# not have a task or Tree)
#
# == sync ==
# It will take some thought to come up with a good progress tracker for sync
# In the case of sync, there are a couple phases before it dives into a
# regular scan-and-copy that has a Tree.  First, the source is checked for
# changes.  While that happens, regular file removes are done on the target.
# Next phase is to handle renames and moves (will be painful with s3) and
# also remove directories bottom-up since you cannot remove non-empty dirs
# Finally, dive into the regular copy which has a tree

# Stat polling frequency
